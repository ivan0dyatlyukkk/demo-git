Baby, I'm preying on you tonight
Hunt you down, eat you alive

Just like animals, animals, like animals, —mals
Maybe you think that you can hide

I can smell your scent from miles
Just like animals, animals, like animals, —mals
Baby, I'm... (Hey)

So what you trying to do to me? (Hey)
It's like we can't stop, we're enemies (Hey)
But we get along when I'm inside you, yeah (Hey)
